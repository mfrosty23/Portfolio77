<p> About Me </p>
<p>  My name is Michael Frost, I am a 15 year old, 10th grade student at Benilde st. Margaret's in Minnesota. I enjoy to play sports like basketball and tennis. I am currently an engineering 2 student, and I am excited to become a better programmer and learn how to use and build things in CAD.</p>
<h4 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple"> Engineering: Useful Skills and Capabilities</h4>
<div>
<ul>
<li> Familiar with slack and know how to use it to problem-solve. </li>
<li> Understanding of how to use python and mac terminal.  </li>
<li> Understanding of basic python programming and capable to use it. </li>
<li> Able to use python to solve math equations, this is especially helpful to solve equations with many variables and equations calculators can't run. </li>
<li> Have a good understanding of html and CSS programming languages and how to use them. </li>
<li> Able to make websites and design them by using html and CSS.  </li>
<li> Able to use and navigate Github, which is an application I can use to clone others code and build off of it. </li>
<li> Able to work well individually as well as with others. </li>
<li> Know to find and use useful resources to help problem-solve. </li>

<h5 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple"> How I developed my engineering skills and capabilities</h5>
<h2 class="darkgreen-text"> Html and CSS </h2>
<p> I learned how to code using html with this <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/define-the-head-and-body-of-an-html-document">this website.</a> I often used youtube and other social media platforms as resources.</p>
<p> I learned a number of elements or attributes and how to use them. Using what I learned I can code my own website. I learned basic html/html5 and a little bit of css("cascading style sheets") which is a coding language used in collaboration with html to style your code, for example using CSS commands I can make borders, change fonts and colors and much more.</p>
<p> the picture below this paragraph will act as a link when clicked on. Although I could make it work as a link to any website I coded it to be a dead link.</p>
<a href="#footer" id="footer"><img class="thick-darkgreen-border" src="michaelPhoto.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="picture of creator"/></a>
<p> I also learned how to make bullet point and number lists like the lists below</p>

<ul>
<li>Michael</li>
<li>Robert</li>
<li>Frost</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Benilde</li>
<li>Saint</li>
<li>Margaret's</li>
</ol>

<p> Some of the more complicated things I learned are making multiple choice, checkbox questions and if I choose I can add in code that will make the questions required and/or record the data(but I decided to not include either).</p> 

<p> What state is Benilde St. Margaret's highschool located in?</p>
<label> <input type="radio" name="Texas-Minnesota-Arkansas-Ohio">Texas</label>
<label> <input type="radio" name="Texas-Minnesota-Arkansas-Ohio">Minnesota</label>
<label> <input type="radio" name="Texas-Minnesota-Arkansas-Ohio">Arkansas</label>
<label> <input type="radio" name="Texas-Minnesota-Arkansas-Ohio">Ohio</label>

<p> Which of the four names, are names of Benilde teachers?</p>
<label for="Paul Wichser"><input id="Paul Wichser" type="checkbox" name="benilde teachers">Paul Wichser</label>
<label for="Katie Sullivan"><input id="Katie Sullivan" type="checkbox" name="benilde teachers">Katie Sullivan</label>

<h3 class="darkgreen-text"> python and programming modules </h3>
<p> Learning the basics of python </p>
<p> for the first quarter of engineering 2, I decided to do programming and work with 2 of my classmates. we used <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">code academy</a> to learn python. The 3 of us would work at the same pace and help each other out when one of us was stuck. we would work for about an hour of our hour and twenty minute class, we would work for thirty minutes then take a ten minute break to recap what we learned and decide what information to add to our notes about python.</p>
<p> Module 31 </p>
<p> after we were done using code academy, my group and I started on Module 31. To complete module 31, we needed to learn what a terminal was and how to use it. We used google, the engineering wiki, slack, youtube and also talked to classmates, upperclassmen and siblings as resourcess to learn and apply what we needed to. We had to learn what the following commands were and how to use them in a terminal: cd, ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, touch.</p>
<ul>
<li> cd= 'Change directory' which is used to change the current working directory in various operating systems.</li>
<li> ls= 'List files' which is used to list all files in the current directory except for hidden files.</li>
<li> cp= 'copy' used to copy files or group of files or directory. It creates an exact image of a file on a disk with a different file name.</li>
<li> mv= 'filename' 'path/to/new/file/location' used to move directories or files to a different location.</li>
<li> mkdir= This command can create multiple directories at once as well as set the permissions for the directories.</li>
<li> Touch= actually, the touch command is for updating the access / modified date of a file.</li>
</ul>
<p> After that the only other task we needed to complete module was to use python to solve a simple math problem. We decided to make a problem where we would use python to give the answer for the average daily temperature during summer, with the average daily temperatures for June, July, and August already given. To do this we took the three summer months and we defined them and set them equal to their average daily temperatures. After that we used python to add the 3 numbers and set the answer of that equal to variable representing the sum of the 3 numbers, then we divided that variable by 3 and had it equal a variable representing our answer for the average daily temperature for all 3 given months and then print that variable to receive our answer. Finally, when we ran it in the terminal using the commands we learned earlier in the module we were able to the answer of our problem.</p>

<p> Module 34 <p>
<p> Module 34, is a module in which you learn how to use Github, what you have to do is: clone a repository, create a branch within that repository, then push and commit changes of a certain block of code to my own branch to edit the code and add what I need to. In short, after completing module 34, I learned how to use Github and I am now able to use it to clone others code and build off of it.</p>
